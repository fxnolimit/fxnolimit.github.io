        Variations of basketball are activities based on the game of basketball, using common basketball skills and
        equipment (primarily the ball and basket). Some variations are only superficial rules changes, while others are
        distinct games with varying degrees of basketball influences. Other variations include children's games,
        contests or activities meant to help players reinforce skills.
        There are principal basketball sports with variations on basketball including Wheelchair basketball, Water
        basketball, Beach basketball, Slamball, Streetball and Unicycle basketball. An earlier version of basketball,
        played primarily by women and girls, was Six-on-six basketball. Horseball is a game played on horseback where a
        ball is handled and points are scored by shooting it through a high net (approximately 1.5m×1.5m). The sport is
        like a combination of polo, rugby, and basketball. There is even a form played on donkeys known as Donkey
        basketball, but that version has come under attack from animal rights groups.

    <h2>Half-court</h2>
    <p>
        Perhaps the single most common variation of basketball is the half-court game, played in informal settings
        without referees or strict rules. Only one basket is used, and the ball must be "taken back" or "cleared" –
        passed or dribbled outside the three-point line each time possession of the ball changes from one team to the
        other. Half-court games require less cardiovascular stamina, since players need not run back and forth a full
        court. Half-court raises the number of players that can use a court or, conversely, can be played if there is an
        insufficient number to form full 5-on-5 teams.
        Half-court basketball is usually played 1-on-1, 2-on-2 or 3-on-3. The latter variation is gradually gaining
        official recognition as 3x3, originally known as FIBA 33. It was first tested at the 2007 Asian Indoor Games in
        Macau and the first official tournaments were held at the 2009 Asian Youth Games and the 2010 Youth Olympics,
        both in Singapore. The first FIBA 3x3 Youth World Championships were held in Rimini, Italy in 2011, with the
        first FIBA 3x3 World Championships for senior teams following a year later in Athens. The sport is highly tipped
        to become an Olympic sport as early as 2016. In the summer of 2017, the BIG3 basketball league, a
        professional 3x3 half court basketball league that features former NBA players, began. The BIG3 features several
        rule variants including a four-point field goal.
