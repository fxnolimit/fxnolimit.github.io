            Following the summer break, teams begin training camps in late September. Training camps allow the coaching
            staff to evaluate players (especially rookies), scout the team's strengths and weaknesses, prepare the
            players
            for the rigorous regular season, and determine the 12-man active roster (and a 3-man inactive list) with
            which
            they will begin the regular season. Teams have the ability to assign players with less than two years of
            experience to the NBA G League. After training camp, a series of preseason exhibition games are held.
            Preseason
            matches are sometimes held in non-NBA cities, both in the United States and overseas. The NBA regular season
            begins in the last week of October.
            During the regular season, each team plays 82 games, 41 each home and away. A team faces opponents in its
            own
            division four times a year (16 games). Each team plays six of the teams from the other two divisions in its
            conference four times (24 games), and the remaining four teams three times (12 games). Finally, each team
            plays
            all the teams in the other conference twice apiece (30 games). This asymmetrical structure means the
            strength of
            schedule will vary between teams (but not as significantly as the NFL or MLB). Over five seasons, each team
            will
            have played 80 games against their division (20 games against each opponent, 10 at home, 10 on the road),
            180
            games against the rest of their conference (18 games against each opponent, 9 at home, 9 on the road), and
            150
            games against the other conference (10 games against each team, 5 at home, 5 on the road).
            The NBA is one of only two of the four major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada in
            which teams play every other team during the regular season (the other being the National Hockey League).
            Each
            team hosts and visits every other team at least once every season. From 2005 to 2008, the NBA had the
            distinction of being the only one of the four major leagues in which all teams play every other team.
            The NBA is also the only league that regularly schedules games on Christmas Day. The league has been playing
            games regularly on the holiday since 1947, though the first Christmas Day games were not televised until
            1983–84. Games played on this day have featured some of the best teams and players. Christmas is
            also notable for NBA on television, as the holiday is when the first NBA games air on network television
            each
            season. Games played on this day have been some of the highest-rated games during a particular season.
            In February, the regular season pauses to celebrate the annual NBA All-Star Game. Fans vote throughout the
            United States, Canada, and on the Internet, and the top vote-getters in each conference are named captains.
            Fan
            votes determine the rest of the allstar starters. Coaches vote to choose the remaining 14 All-Stars. Then,
            the
            top vote-getters in each conference draft their own team from a player pool of allstars. The top vote-getter
            in
            the league earns first pick and so forth. The player with the best performance during the game is rewarded
            with
            a Game MVP award. Other attractions of the All-Star break include the Rising Stars Challenge (originally
            Rookie
            Challenge), where the top rookies and second-year players in the NBA play in a 5-on-5 basketball game, with
            the
            current format pitting U.S. players against those from the rest of the world; the Skills Challenge, where
            players compete to finish an obstacle course consisting of shooting, passing, and dribbling in the fastest
            time;
            the Three Point Contest, where players compete to score the highest number of three-point field goals in a
            given
            time; and the NBA Slam Dunk Contest, where players compete to dunk the ball in the most entertaining way
            according to the judges. These other attractions have varying names which include the names of the various
            sponsors who have paid for naming rights.
            Shortly after the All-Star break is the trade deadline, which is set to fall on the 16th Thursday of the
            season
            (usually in February) at 3pm Eastern Time. After this date, teams are not allowed to exchange players with
            each other for the remainder of the season, although they may still sign and release players. Major trades
            are
            often completed right before the trading deadline, making that day a hectic time for general managers.
            Around the middle of April, the regular season ends. It is during this time that voting begins for
            individual
            awards, as well as the selection of the honorary, league-wide, post-season teams. The Sixth Man of the Year
            Award is given to the best player coming off the bench (must have more games coming off the bench than
            actual
            games started). The Rookie of the Year Award is awarded to the most outstanding first-year player. The Most
            Improved Player Award is awarded to the player who is deemed to have shown the most improvement from the
            previous season. The Defensive Player of the Year Award is awarded to the league's best defender. The Coach
            of
            the Year Award is awarded to the coach that has made the most positive difference to a team. The Most
            Valuable
            Player Award is given to the player deemed the most valuable for (his team) that season. Additionally,
            Sporting
            News awards an unofficial (but widely recognized) Executive of the Year Award to the general manager who is
            adjudged to have performed the best job for the benefit of his franchise.
            The post-season teams are the All-NBA Team, the All-Defensive Team, and the All-Rookie Team; each consists
            of
            five players. There are three All-NBA teams, consisting of the top players at each position, with first-team
            status being the most desirable. There are two All-Defensive teams, consisting of the top defenders at each
            position. There are also two All-Rookie teams, consisting of the top first-year players regardless of
            position

        <h2>Playoffs</h2>
        <p>
            The NBA playoffs begin in April after the conclusion of the regular season with the top eight teams in each
            conference, regardless of divisional alignment, competing for the league's championship title, the Larry
            O'Brien Championship Trophy. Seeds are awarded in strict order of regular season record (with a tiebreaker
            system used as needed).
            Having a higher seed offers several advantages. Since the first seed begins the playoffs playing against the
            eighth seed, the second seed plays the seventh seed, the third seed plays the sixth seed, and the fourth
            seed plays the fifth seed, having a higher seed means a team faces a weaker team in the first round. The
            team in each series with the better record has home court advantage, including the First Round. Before the
            league changed its playoff determination format for the 2006–07 season, this meant that, for example, if the
            team that received the sixth seed had a better record than the team with the third seed (by virtue of a
            divisional championship), the sixth seed would have home court advantage, even though the other team had a
            higher seed. Therefore, the team with the best regular season record in the league is guaranteed home court
            advantage in every series it plays. For example, in 2006, the Denver Nuggets won 44 games and captured the
            Northwest Division and the third seed. Their opponent was the sixth-seeded Los Angeles Clippers, who won 47
            games and finished second in the Pacific Division. Although Denver won its much weaker division, the
            Clippers had home-court advantage and won the series in 5.
            The playoffs follow a tournament format. Each team plays an opponent in a best-of-seven series, with the
            first team to win four games advancing into the next round, while the other team is eliminated from the
            playoffs. In the next round, the successful team plays against another advancing team of the same
            conference. All but one team in each conference are eliminated from the playoffs. Since the NBA does not
            re-seed teams, the playoff bracket in each conference uses a traditional design, with the winner of the
            series matching the first- and eighth-seeded teams playing the winner of the series matching the fourth- and
            fifth-seeded teams, and the winner of the series matching the second- and seventh-seeded teams playing the
            winner of the series matching the third- and sixth-seeded teams. In every round, the best-of-7 series
            follows a 2–2–1–1–1 home-court pattern, meaning that one team will have home court in games 1, 2, 5, and 7,
            while the other plays at home in games 3, 4, and 6. From 1985 to 2013, the NBA Finals followed a 2–3–2
            pattern, meaning that one team had home court in games 1, 2, 6, and 7, while the other played at home in
            games 3, 4, and 5.
            The final playoff round, a best-of-seven series between the victors of both conferences, is known as the NBA
            Finals, and is held annually in June. The winner of the NBA Finals receives the Larry O'Brien Championship
            Trophy. Each player and major contributor—including coaches and the general manager—on the winning team
            receive a championship ring. In addition, the league awards the Bill Russell NBA Finals Most Valuable Player
            Award to the best performing player of the series.
            The league began using its current format, with the top eight teams in each conference advancing regardless
            of divisional alignment, in the 2015–16 season. Previously, the top three seeds went to the division winners
        </p>

        <h2>Championships</h2>
        <p>
            The Boston Celtics have won the most championships with 17 NBA Finals wins. The second most successful
            franchise is the Los Angeles Lakers, who have 16 overall championships (11 in Los Angeles, 5 in
            Minneapolis). Following the Lakers, are the Chicago Bulls and Golden State Warriors (2 in Philadelphia, 4 in
            Oakland) with six championships each. The San Antonio Spurs have five championships, all since 1999.
