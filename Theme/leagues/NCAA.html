            Intercollegiate sports began in the US in 1852 when crews from Harvard and Yale universities met in a
            challenge race in the sport of rowing. As rowing remained the preeminent sport in the country into the
            late-1800s, many of the initial debates about collegiate athletic eligibility and purpose were settled
            through organizations like the Rowing Association of American Colleges and the Intercollegiate Rowing
            Association. As other sports emerged, notably football and basketball, many of these same concepts and
            standards were adopted. Football, in particular, began to emerge as a marquee sport, but the rules of the
            game itself were in constant flux and often had to be adapted for each contest.
            The NCAA dates its formation to two White House conferences convened by President Theodore Roosevelt in the
            early 20th century in response to repeated injuries and deaths in college football which had "prompted many
            college and universities to discontinue the sport." Following those White House meetings and the reforms
            which had resulted, Chancellor Henry MacCracken of New York University organized a meeting of 13 colleges
            and universities to initiate changes in football playing rules; at a follow-on meeting on December 28, 1905
            in New York, 62 higher-education institutions became charter members of the Intercollegiate Athletic
            Association of the United States (IAAUS). The IAAUS was officially established on March 31, 1906, and
            took its present name, the NCAA, in 1910.
            For several years, the NCAA was a discussion group and rules-making body, but in 1921, the first NCAA
            national championship was conducted: the National Collegiate Track and Field Championships. Gradually, more
            rules committees were formed and more championships were created, including a basketball championship in
            1939.
            A series of crises brought the NCAA to a crossroads after World War II. The "Sanity Code" – adopted to
            establish guidelines for recruiting and financial aid – failed to curb abuses. Postseason football games
            were multiplying with little control, and member schools were increasingly concerned about how the new
            medium of television would affect football attendance
            The complexity of those problems and the growth in membership and championships demonstrated the need for
            full-time professional leadership. Walter Byers, previously a part-time executive asistant, was named
            executive director in 1951, and a national headquarters was established in Kansas City, Missouri in 1952.
            Byers wasted no time placing his stamp on the Association. A program to control live television of football
            games was approved, the annual Convention delegated enforcement powers to the Association's Council, and
            legislation was adopted governing postseason bowl games.

            As college athletics grew, the scope of the nation's athletics programs diverged, forcing the NCAA to create
            a structure that recognized varying levels of emphasis. In 1973, the Association's membership was divided
            into three legislative and competitive divisions – I, II, and III. Five years later in 1978, Division I
            members voted to create subdivisions I-A and I-AA (renamed the Football Bowl Subdivision and the Football
            Championship Subdivision in 2006) in football.
            Until the 1980s, the association did not offer women's athletics. Instead, the Association for
            Intercollegiate Athletics for Women (AIAW), with nearly 1000 member schools, governed women's collegiate
            sports in the United States. The AIAW was in a vulnerable position that precipitated conflicts with the NCAA
            in the early 1980s. Following a one-year overlap in which both organizations staged women's championships,
            the AIAW discontinued operation, and most member schools continued their women's athletics programs under
            the governance of the NCAA. By 1982 all divisions of the NCAA offered national championship events for
            women's athletics. A year later in 1983, the 75th Convention approved an expansion to plan women's athletic
            program services and pushed for a women's championship program.
            By the 1980s, televised college football had become a larger source of income for the NCAA. In September
            1981, the Board of Regents of the University of Oklahoma and the University of Georgia Athletic Association
            filed suit against the NCAA in district court in Oklahoma. The plaintiffs stated that the NCAA's football
            television plan constituted price fixing, output restraints, boycott, and monopolizing, all of which were
            illegal under the Sherman Act. The NCAA argued that its pro-competitive and non-commercial justifications
            for the plan – protection of live gate, maintenance of competitive balance among NCAA member institutions,
            and the creation of a more attractive "product" to compete with other forms of entertainment – combined to
            make the plan reasonable. In September 1982, the district court found in favour of the plaintiffs, ruling
            that the plan violated antitrust laws. It enjoined the Association from enforcing the contract. The NCAA
            appealed all the way to the United States Supreme Court, but lost in 1984 in the 7–2 ruling NCAA v. Board of
            Regents of the University of Oklahoma. (If the television contracts the NCAA had with ABC, CBS, and ESPN
            had remained in effect for the 1984 season, they would have generated some $73.6 million for the Association
            and its members.)
            In 1999, the NCAA was sued for discriminating against female athletes under Title IX for systematically
            giving men in graduate school more waivers than a woman to participate in college sports. In National
            Collegiate Athletic Association v. Smith, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the NCAA was not subject to that
            law, without reviewing the merits of the discrimination claim.
            Over the last two decades recruiting international athletes has become a growing trend among NCAA
            institutions. For example, most German athletes outside of Germany are based at US universities. For many
            European athletes, the American universities are the only option to pursue an academic and athletic career
            at the same time. Many of these students come to the US with high academic expectations and aspirations.
            In 2009, Simon Fraser University in Burnaby, British Columbia, became the NCAA's first non-US member
            institution.
            In 2014, the NCAA set a record high of a $989 Million in net revenue. This being just shy of $1 billion, it
            is among the highest of all large sports organizations.

        <h2>March Madness</h2>
        <p>
            The NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament, also known and branded as NCAA March Madness, is a
            single-elimination tournament played each spring in the United States, currently featuring 68 college
            basketball teams from the Division I level of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), to
            determine the national championship. The tournament was created in 1939 by the National Association of
            Basketball Coaches, and was the idea of Ohio State coach Harold Olsen. Played mostly during March, it has
            become one of the most famous annual sporting events in the United States.
            The tournament teams include champions from 32 Division I conferences (which receive automatic bids), and 36
            teams which are awarded at-large berths. These "at-large" teams are chosen by an NCAA selection committee,
            then announced in a nationally televised event on the Sunday preceding the "First Four" play-in games,
            currently held in Dayton, Ohio, and dubbed Selection Sunday. The 68 teams are divided into four regions and
            organized into a single-elimination "bracket", which pre-determines, when a team wins a game, which team it
            will face next. Each team is "seeded", or ranked, within its region from 1 to 16. After the First Four, the
            tournament occurs during the course of three weekends, at pre-selected neutral sites across the United
            States. Teams, seeded by rank, proceed through a single-game elimination bracket beginning with a "first
            four" consisting of 8 low-seeded teams playing in 4 games for a position in the first round the Tuesday and
            Wednesday before the first round begins, a first round consisting of 64 teams playing in 32 games over the
            course of a week, the "Sweet Sixteen" and "Elite Eight" rounds the next week and weekend, respectively, and
            – for the last weekend of the tournament – the "Final Four" round. The Final Four is usually played during
            the first weekend of April. These four teams, one from each region (East, South, Midwest, and West), compete
            in a preselected location for the national championship.
            The tournament has been at least partially televised on network television since 1969. Currently, the
            games are broadcast by CBS, TBS, TNT, and truTV under the trade-name NCAA March Madness. These networks paid
            the NCAA to broadcast the games in 2011. The contract was for 14 years and they paid 10.8 billion dollars.
            However, in 2018 that contract was extended for another seven years making it valid through the year 2032.
            The average payment over the years comes out to be 891 million dollars a year. Since 2011, all games are
            available for viewing nationwide and internationally. As television coverage has grown, so too has the
            tournament's popularity. Currently, millions of Americans fill out a bracket, attempting to correctly
            predict the outcome of 63 games of the tournament (not including the First Four games).
            With 11 national titles, UCLA has the record for the most NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championships;
            John Wooden coached UCLA to 10 of its 11 titles. The University of Kentucky (UK) is second, with eight
            national titles. The University of North Carolina is third, with six national titles, and Duke University
            and Indiana University are tied for fourth with five national titles. The University of Connecticut is sixth
            with four national titles. The University of Kansas (KU) & Villanova are tied for 7th with three national
            titles. Since 1985, when the tournament expanded to 64 teams, Duke has won five championships; North
            Carolina and UConn have each won four; Kentucky & Villanova have three; Kansas & Florida have two; and
            Arizona, Arkansas, Indiana, Maryland, Michigan, Michigan State, Louisville, Syracuse, UCLA, UNLV, and
            Virginia have one.
