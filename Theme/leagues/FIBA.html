            FIBA defines the rules of basketball, specifies the equipment and facilities required, organises
            international competitions, regulates the transfer of athletes across countries, and controls the
            appointment of international referees. A total of 213 national federations are now members, organized since
            1989 into five zones: Africa, Americas, Asia, Europe, and Oceania.
            The FIBA Basketball World Cup is a world tournament for men's national teams held every four years. Teams
            compete for the Naismith Trophy, named in honor of basketball's Canadian creator James Naismith. The
            tournament structure is similar but not identical to that of the FIFA World Cup in football; these
            tournaments occurred in the same year from 1970 through 2014, but starting in 2019, the Basketball World Cup
            will move to the year following the FIFA World Cup. A parallel event for women's teams, the FIBA Women's
            Basketball World Cup, is also held quadrennially; from 1986 through 2014, it was held in the same year as
            the men's event but in a different country. The women's tournament will continue to be held in the same year
            as the FIFA World Cup.
            In 2009 FIBA announced three new tournaments: two 12-team U-17 World Championships (one each for men and
            women) to be played in July 2010, and an eight-team FIBA World Club Championship to be launched in October
            2010. However, the FIBA World Club Championship did not materialize. In its place, FIBA instead relaunched
            its original world club championship for men, the FIBA Intercontinental Cup, in 2013.
            The newest global FIBA tournaments for national teams are in the three-player half-court variation, 3x3. The
            FIBA 3x3 U-18 World Championships were inaugurated in 2011, and the FIBA 3x3 World Championships for senior
            teams followed a year later. All events initially included separate tournaments for men's, women's, and
            mixed teams, but mixed championships are no longer contested. The U-18 championships, held annually, feature
            32 teams in each individual tournament. The senior championships have 24 teams in each individual
            tournament, and are held in even-numbered years.
