        <h2>High school basketball</h2>
        <p>
            Before widespread school district consolidation, most American high schools were far smaller than their
            present-day counterparts. During the first decades of the 20th century, basketball quickly became the ideal
            interscholastic sport due to its modest equipment and personnel requirements. In the days before widespread
            television coverage of professional and college sports, the popularity of high school basketball was
            unrivaled
            in many parts of America. Perhaps the most legendary of high school teams was Indiana's Franklin Wonder
            Five,
            which took the nation by storm during the 1920s, dominating Indiana basketball and earning national
            recognition.
            Today virtually every high school in the United States fields a basketball team in varsity competition.
            Basketball's popularity remains high, both in rural areas where they carry the identification of the entire
            community, as well as at some larger schools known for their basketball teams where many players go on to
            participate at higher levels of competition after graduation. In the 2016–17 season, 980,673 boys and girls
            represented their schools in interscholastic basketball competition, according to the National Federation of
            State High School Associations. The states of Illinois, Indiana and Kentucky are particularly well known for
            their residents' devotion to high school basketball, commonly called Hoosier Hysteria in Indiana; the
            critically
            acclaimed film Hoosiers shows high school basketball's depth of meaning to these communities.
            There is currently no tournament to determine a national high school champion. The most serious effort was
            the
            National Interscholastic Basketball Tournament at the University of Chicago from 1917 to 1930. The event was
            organized by Amos Alonzo Stagg and sent invitations to state champion teams. The tournament started out as a
            mostly Midwest affair but grew. In 1929 it had 29 state champions. Faced with opposition from the National
            Federation of State High School Associations and North Central Association of Colleges and Schools that bore
            a
            threat of the schools losing their accreditation the last tournament was in 1930. The organizations said
            they
            were concerned that the tournament was being used to recruit professional players from the prep ranks. The
            tournament did not invite minority schools or private/parochial schools.
            The National Catholic Interscholastic Basketball Tournament ran from 1924 to 1941 at Loyola University. The
            National Catholic Invitational Basketball Tournament from 1954 to 1978 played at a series of venues,
            including
            Catholic University, Georgetown and George Mason.[23] The National Interscholastic Basketball Tournament for
            Black High Schools was held from 1929 to 1942 at Hampton Institute. The National Invitational
            Interscholastic Basketball Tournament was held from 1941 to 1967 starting out at Tuskegee Institute.
            Following a
            pause during World War II it resumed at Tennessee State College in Nashville. The basis for the champion
            dwindled after 1954 when Brown v. Board of Education began an integration of schools. The last tournaments
            were
            held at Alabama State College from 1964 to 1967.

        <h2>College basketball</h2>
        <p>
            Basketball's early adherents were dispatched to YMCAs throughout the United States, and it quickly spread
            through the United States and Canada. By 1895, it was well established at several women's high schools.
            While
            the YMCA was responsible for initially developing and spreading the game, within a decade it discouraged the
            new
            sport, as rough play and rowdy crowds began to detract from the YMCA's primary mission. However, other
            amateur
            sports clubs, colleges, and professional clubs quickly filled the void. In the years before World War I, the
            Amateur Athletic Union and the Intercollegiate Athletic Association of the United States (forerunner of the
            NCAA) vied for control over the rules for the game. The first pro league, the National Basketball League,
            was
            formed in 1898 to protect players from exploitation and to promote a less rough game. This league only
            lasted
            five years.
            James Naismith was instrumental in establishing college basketball. His colleague C.O. Beamis fielded the
            first
            college basketball team just a year after the Springfield YMCA game at the suburban Pittsburgh Geneva
            College. Naismith himself later coached at the University of Kansas for six years, before handing the reins
            to renowned coach Forrest "Phog" Allen. Naismith's disciple Amos Alonzo Stagg brought basketball to the
            University of Chicago, while Adolph Rupp, a student of Naismith's at Kansas, enjoyed great success as coach
            at
            the University of Kentucky. On February 9, 1895, the first intercollegiate 5-on-5 game was played at Hamline
            University between Hamline and the School of Agriculture, which was affiliated with the University of
            Minnesota. The School of Agriculture won in a 9–3 game.
            In 1901, colleges, including the University of Chicago, Columbia University, Cornell University, Dartmouth
            College, the University of Minnesota, the U.S. Naval Academy, the University of Colorado and Yale University
            began sponsoring men's games. In 1905, frequent injuries on the football field prompted President Theodore
            Roosevelt to suggest that colleges form a governing body, resulting in the creation of the Intercollegiate
            Athletic Association of the United States (IAAUS). In 1910, that body would change its name to the National
            Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA). The first Canadian interuniversity basketball game was played at the
            YMCA in Kingston, Ontario on February 6, 1904, when McGill University—Naismith's alma mater—visited Queen's
            University. McGill won 9–7 in overtime; the score was 7–7 at the end of regulation play, and a ten-minute
            overtime period settled the outcome. A good turnout of spectators watched the game.
            The first men's national championship tournament, the National Association of Intercollegiate Basketball
            tournament, which still exists as the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA) tournament,
            was
            organized in 1937. The first national championship for NCAA teams, the National Invitation Tournament (NIT)
            in
            New York, was organized in 1938; the NCAA national tournament would begin one year later. College basketball
            was
            rocked by gambling scandals from 1948 to 1951, when dozens of players from top teams were implicated in
            match
            fixing and point shaving. Partially spurred by an association with cheating, the NIT lost support to the
            NCAA
            tournament.

        <h2>Professional basketball</h2>
        <p>
            Teams abounded throughout the 1920s. There were hundreds of men's professional basketball teams in towns and
            cities all over the United States, and little organization of the professional game. Players jumped from
            team to
            team and teams played in armories and smoky dance halls. Leagues came and went. Barnstorming squads such as
            the
            Original Celtics and two all-African American teams, the New York Renaissance Five ("Rens") and the (still
            existing) Harlem Globetrotters played up to two hundred games a year on their national tours.
            In 1946, the Basketball Association of America (BAA) was formed. The first game was played in Toronto,
            Ontario,
            Canada between the Toronto Huskies and New York Knickerbockers on November 1, 1946. Three seasons later, in
            1949, the BAA merged with the National Basketball League (NBL) to form the National Basketball Association
            (NBA). By the 1950s, basketball had become a major college sport, thus paving the way for a growth of
            interest
            in professional basketball. In 1959, a basketball hall of fame was founded in Springfield, Massachusetts,
            site
            of the first game. Its rosters include the names of great players, coaches, referees and people who have
            contributed significantly to the development of the game. The hall of fame has people who have accomplished
            many
            goals in their career in basketball. An upstart organization, the American Basketball Association, emerged
            in
            1967 and briefly threatened the NBA's dominance until the ABA-NBA merger in 1976. Today the NBA is the top
            professional basketball league in the world in terms of popularity, salaries, talent, and level of
            competition.
            The NBA has featured many famous players, including George Mikan, the first dominating "big man";
            ball-handling
            wizard Bob Cousy and defensive genius Bill Russell of the Boston Celtics; charismatic center Wilt
            Chamberlain,
            who originally played for the barnstorming Harlem Globetrotters; all-around stars Oscar Robertson and Jerry
            West; more recent big men Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Shaquille O'Neal, Hakeem Olajuwon and Karl Malone; playmakers
            John Stockton, Isiah Thomas and Steve Nash; crowd-pleasing forwards Julius Erving and Charles Barkley;
            European
            stars Dirk Nowitzki, Pau Gasol and Tony Parker; more recent superstars LeBron James, Allen Iverson and Kobe
            Bryant; and the three players who many credit with ushering the professional game to its highest level of
            popularity during the 1980s and 1990s: Larry Bird, Earvin "Magic" Johnson, and Michael Jordan.
            In 2001, the NBA formed a developmental league, the National Basketball Development League (later known as
            the
            NBA D-League and then the NBA G League after a branding deal with Gatorade). As of the 2018–19 season, the G
            League has 27 teams.

        <h2>International basketball</h2>
        <p>
            FIBA (International Basketball Federation) was formed in 1932 by eight founding nations: Argentina,
            Czechoslovakia, Greece, Italy, Latvia, Portugal, Romania and Switzerland. At this time, the organization
            only
            oversaw amateur players. Its acronym, derived from the French Fédération Internationale de Basket-ball
            Amateur,
            was thus "FIBA". Men's basketball was first included at the Berlin 1936 Summer Olympics, although a
            demonstration tournament was held in 1904. The United States defeated Canada in the first final, played
            outdoors. This competition has usually been dominated by the United States, whose team has won all but three
            titles. The first of these came in a controversial final game in Munich in 1972 against the Soviet Union, in
            which the ending of the game was replayed three times until the Soviet Union finally came out on top.[26] In
            1950 the first FIBA World Championship for men, now known as the FIBA Basketball World Cup, was held in
            Argentina. Three years later, the first FIBA World Championship for women, now known as the FIBA Women's
            Basketball World Cup, was held in Chile. Women's basketball was added to the Olympics in 1976, which were
            held
            in Montreal, Quebec, Canada with teams such as the Soviet Union, Brazil and Australia rivaling the American
            squads.
            In 1989, FIBA allowed professional NBA players to participate in the Olympics for the first time. Prior to
            the
            1992 Summer Olympics, only European and South American teams were allowed to field professionals in the
            Olympics. The United States' dominance continued with the introduction of the original Dream Team. In the
            2004
            Athens Olympics, the United States suffered its first Olympic loss while using professional players, falling
            to
            Puerto Rico (in a 19-point loss) and Lithuania in group games, and being eliminated in the semifinals by
            Argentina. It eventually won the bronze medal defeating Lithuania, finishing behind Argentina and Italy. The
            Redeem Team, won gold at the 2008 Olympics, and the B-Team, won gold at the 2010 FIBA World Championship in
            Turkey despite featuring no players from the 2008 squad. The United States continued its dominance as they
            won
            gold at the 2012 Olympics, 2014 FIBA World Cup and the 2016 Olympics.
