        <p>
            Variations of basketball are activities based on the game of basketball, using common basketball skills
            and
            equipment (primarily the ball and basket). Some variations are only superficial rules changes, while
            others are
            distinct games with varying degrees of basketball influences. Other variations include children's games,
            contests or activities meant to help players reinforce skills.
            There are principal basketball sports with variations on basketball including Wheelchair basketball,
            Water
            basketball, Beach basketball, Slamball, Streetball and Unicycle basketball. An earlier version of
            basketball,
            played primarily by women and girls, was Six-on-six basketball. Horseball is a game played on horseback
            where a
            ball is handled and points are scored by shooting it through a high net (approximately 1.5m×1.5m). The
            sport is
            like a combination of polo, rugby, and basketball. There is even a form played on donkeys known as
            Donkey
            basketball, but that version has come under attack from animal rights groups.
        </p>

        <h2>Half-court</h2>
        <p>
            Perhaps the single most common variation of basketball is the half-court game, played in informal
            settings
            without referees or strict rules. Only one basket is used, and the ball must be "taken back" or
            "cleared" –
            passed or dribbled outside the three-point line each time possession of the ball changes from one team
            to the
            other. Half-court games require less cardiovascular stamina, since players need not run back and forth a
            full
            court. Half-court raises the number of players that can use a court or, conversely, can be played if
            there is an
            insufficient number to form full 5-on-5 teams.
            Half-court basketball is usually played 1-on-1, 2-on-2 or 3-on-3. The latter variation is gradually
            gaining
            official recognition as 3x3, originally known as FIBA 33. It was first tested at the 2007 Asian Indoor
            Games in
            Macau and the first official tournaments were held at the 2009 Asian Youth Games and the 2010 Youth
            Olympics,
            both in Singapore. The first FIBA 3x3 Youth World Championships were held in Rimini, Italy in 2011, with
            the
            first FIBA 3x3 World Championships for senior teams following a year later in Athens. The sport is
            highly tipped
            to become an Olympic sport as early as 2016. In the summer of 2017, the BIG3 basketball league, a
            professional 3x3 half court basketball league that features former NBA players, began. The BIG3 features
            several
            rule variants including a four-point field goal.

        <h2>Social forms of basketball</h2>
        <h3>Recreational basketball</h3>
        <p>
            Basketball is played widely casually in schools and colleges where fun, entertainment and camaraderie
            rule rather than winning a game.
            Basketball Schools and Academies, where students are trained in developing basketball fundamentals,
            undergo fitness and endurance exercises and learn various basketball skills. Basketball students learn
            proper ways of passing, ball handling, dribbling, shooting from various distances, rebounding, offensive
            moves, defense, layups, screens, basketball rules and basketball ethics. Also popular are the basketball
            camps organized for various occasions, often to get prepared for basketball events, and basketball
            clinics for improving skills.
        </p>

        <h3>Disabled basketball</h3>
        <p>
            Disabled basketball is played by various disabled groups, such as the deaf and physically crippled
            people.
            Deaf basketball is one of several deaf sports, deaf basketball relies on signing for communication. Any
            deaf sporting event that happens, its purpose is to serve as a catalyst for the socialization of a
            low-incidence and geographically dispersed population.
            Wheelchair basketball is a sport based on basketball but designed for disabled people in wheelchairs and
            considered one of the major disabled sports practiced.There is a functional classification system that
            is used to help determine if the wheelchair basketball player classification system reflects the
            existing differences in the performance of elite female players. what this system does is it gives an
            analysis of the players' functional resources through field-testing and game observation. During this
            system's process, players are assigned a score of 1 to 4.5
        </p>

        <h3>Prison basketball</h3>
        <p>
            Prison basketball is practiced in prisons and penitentiary institutions. Active religious basketball
            missionary groups also play basketball with prisoners. Some prisons have developed their own prison
            basketball leagues. At times, non-prisoners may play in such leagues, provided all home and away games
            are played within prison courts. Film director Jason Moriarty has released a documentary relating to the
            sport, entitled Prison Ball. Prison systems in the United States makes about $74 billion a year. The
            reason why prisons make so much money in a year is the fact that over 2.3 million Americans are
            currently incarcerated. It all started in 1972, the number of people in the United States prison has
            increased over 700% and now charges the taxpayer $39 billion to maintain every year. US population is
            only a little smaller than countries like Iceland, Estonia and Cyprus combined, so it was not a surprise
            that the US penal system has developed its own type of subculture. There is a lot of people that when
            they hear "correctional facility" think about men behind bars and playing card and lifting weights in
            the yard. That's almost correct but most people don't know that there is a wide range of athletic
            opportunities available in today's penitentiaries. Prison leagues are becoming the best way and most
            popular way inmates spend their time. For younger offenders, basketball is a good way to get their lives
            back on track, but for long term prisoners, these basketball leagues are a great way for them to get
            away from all their daily problems. Some prison leagues sometimes get blessed with their own
            celebrities. "Pee Wee" Kirkland who was drafted by the Chicago Bulls, but turned it down because he was
            making way more money in the drug world. Eventually caught up and arrested, he then found himself
            playing in the Anthracite Basketball League, representing Lewis-burgh penitentiary. Also, another
            celebrity Michael Vick used the football prison league to stay in shape. Some other big names that
            played in prison basketball leagues are Allen Iverson, JR Smith and Plaxico Burress, for some prison
            leagues can be a valuable training ground
        </p>

        <h3>Show basketball</h3>
        <p>
            Show basketball is performed by entertainment basketball show teams, the prime example being the Harlem
            Globetrotters. There are even specialized entertainment teams, such as teams of celebrities, people with
            short heights and others.
            Celebrity basketball teams made of celebrities (actors, singers, and so on.) playing in their own
            leagues or in public, often for entertainment and charity events;
            Midget basketball teams made up of athletes of short stature offering shows using basketball;
            Slamball offered as entertainment events. Slamball is a very intense form of basketball game actually it
            is an elevated game of basketball that is infused with football tactics and involves bouncing of a
            trampolines. This game is very popular in places like Europe and Australia, this intense game is
            full of contact just like football the trampolines are embedded in the floor around the baskets. The
            objective of the game is just like any sport you have to score points by getting the ball into the
            basket, this is mostly done by the player using the trampoline to go fly high in the air to come down
            with slam dunk. Not only do they use tactics from football but they also do the same style of
            substitution as hockey well you can say it's very similar. The potions of slamball are stopper, gunner
            and handler. The stopper is the defender and is in control of the whole defensive plan. The handler is
            basically the point guard of the game, their in control of setting plays on the offensive end and helps
            a little on defensive end as well. The last position the gunner is the one that does most of the scoring
            and all also helps out on the defensive end.

        <h3>Fantasy basketball</h3>
        <p>
            Fantasy basketball was popularized during the 1990s after the advent of the Internet. Those who play this
            game are sometimes referred to as General Managers, who draft actual NBA players and compute their
            basketball statistics. The game was popularized by ESPN Fantasy Sports, NBA.com, and Yahoo! Fantasy Sports.
            Other sports websites provided the same format keeping the game interesting with participants actually
            owning specific players.
        </p>

        <h3>Ethnic and Religion-based basketball</h3>
        <p>
            Examples of ethnic basketball include Indo-Pak or Russian or Armenian leagues in the United States or
            Canada, for example, or Filipino expatriate basketball leagues in the Gulf or the United States.
            Religion-based basketball includes, most notably, church-related Christian basketball leagues, Jewish,
            Muslim and Hindu basketball leagues, and so on. or denominational leagues like Coptic, Syriac/Assyrian
            basketball leagues in the United States or Canada.
