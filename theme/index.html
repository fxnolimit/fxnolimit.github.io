            I am a big fan of the game of basketball. I used to be part of my high school basketball team, and I once in
            a while play with friends in recreative leagues in Seattle.
            It is my pleasure to put this content for anyone interested in learning more about the game of basketball
            and share my passion with you.
            All the content found on this website is from several pages on <a
                href="https://wikipedia.org">wikipedia.com</a>
            Here are a list of pages that have inspired this website:

            Here is what people say about the game:
        </p>

        <p>"Basketball is a wonderful mixture of finesse and strength, style and substance, offense, offense, offense,
            and defense. People like basketball for so many different reasons."
        </p>

        <p>
            "Basketball is an exciting fast paced game where real athletes get to show off their skills. Once you're
            able
            to play the game effectively or understand it well enough to watch, then it becomes awesome"
        </p>

        <p>
            "I love basketball because it has so many parts. It's physical, but then there's the mental piece. You
            have to think to run plays. There are so many things coming at you at a very fast pace, and you have to
            react and figure it all out."
        </p>
        <p>
            I grew to love all the little things, too. Calling just the right play and watching your big man score,
            hitting a teammate with a perfect backdoor pass, reading someone’s eyes and getting a steal, sprinting back
            on defense to stop a fast break, getting a lucky bounce on a floater, helping a teammate up after he takes a
            charge, high-fiving everyone on the floor after an and-one, releasing a shot and just knowing it's a swish,
            setting a hard screen that frees someone for an open look, viscerally feeling the momentum shift in the
            middle of a big comeback — it all added up to something great.
        </p>

            To me, I love this game because when I start playing, I'm captivated by it. I'm zoned-in. All that matters
            is what plays the opposite team is making. How to defend every single play well. The fast paced environment
            on the court get me hyped-up very fast and it usually gets competitve both individually or collectively
            It's okay if you are not familiar with all the technical term used above, hopefully after you navigate this
            website, you'll be an expert in basketball linguo.

            Basketball is a team sport in which two teams, most commonly of five players each, opposing one another
            on a rectangular court, compete with the primary objective of shooting a basketball through the
            defender's hoop while preventing the opposing team from shooting through their own hoop
            Basketball is a team sport in which two teams, most commonly of five players each, opposing one another on a
            rectangular court, compete with the primary objective of shooting a basketball (approximately 9.4 inches (24
            cm) in diameter) through the defender's hoop (a basket 18 inches (46 cm) in diameter mounted 10 feet (3.048
            m) high to a backboard at each end of the court) while preventing the opposing team from shooting through
            their own hoop. A field goal is worth two points, unless made from behind the three-point line, when it is
            worth three. After a foul, timed play stops and the player fouled or designated to shoot a technical foul is
            given one or more one-point free throws. The team with the most points at the end of the game wins, but if
            regulation play expires with the score tied, an additional period of play (overtime) is mandated.
            Players advance the ball by bouncing it while walking or running (dribbling) or by passing it to a teammate,
            both of which require considerable skill. On offense, players may use a variety of shots—the lay-up, the
            jump shot, or a dunk; on defense, they may steal the ball from a dribbler, intercept passes, or block shots;
            either offense or defense may collect a rebound, that is, a missed shot that bounces from rim or backboard.
            It is a violation to lift or drag one's pivot foot without dribbling the ball, to carry it, or to hold the
            ball with both hands then resume dribbling.
            The five players on each side at a time fall into five playing positions: the tallest player is usually the
            center, the tallest and strongest is the power forward, a slightly shorter but more agile big man is the
            small forward, and the shortest players or the best ball handlers are the shooting guard and the point
            guard, who implements the coach's game plan by managing the execution of offensive and defensive plays
            (player positioning). Informally, players may play three-on-three, two-on-two, and one-on-one.
            Invented in 1891 by Canadian-American gym teacher James Naismith in Springfield, Massachusetts, United
            States, basketball has evolved to become one of the world's most popular and widely viewed sports.
